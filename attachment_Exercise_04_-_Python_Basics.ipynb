    "#### Greeter\n",
    "- Write a function that takes in a person's name, and prints out a greeting.\n",
    "    - The greeting must be at least three lines, and the person's name must be in each line.\n",
    "- Use your function to greet at least three different people.\n",
    "- **Bonus:** Store your three people in a list, and call your function from a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Names\n",
    "- Write a function that takes in a first name and a last name, and prints out a nicely formatted full name, in a sentence. Your sentence could be as simple as, \"Hello, *full\\_name*.\"\n",
    "- Call your function three times, with a different name each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addition Calculator\n",
    "- Write a function that takes in two numbers, and adds them together. Make your function print out a sentence showing the two numbers, and the result.\n",
    "- Call your function with three different sets of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Calculator\n",
    "- Modify *Addition Calculator* so that your function returns the sum of the two numbers. The printing should happen outside of the function.\n"
