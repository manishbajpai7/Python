    "- Make a list of names that includes at least four people.\n",
    "- Write an if test that prints a message about the room being crowded, if there are more than three people in your list.\n",
    "- Modify your list so that there are only two people in it. Use one of the methods for removing people from the list, don't just redefine the list.\n",
    "- Run your if test again. There should be no output this time, because there are less than three people in the list.\n",
